The API Latency Monitor is an interactive Python tool that measures the response time of any website or API endpoint. Just run the script, enter one or multiple URLs directly in the console, choose your sample count, timeout, concurrency level, and optional User-Agent spoofing, and the tool instantly performs real-time latency checks. All results are automatically stored in two CSV files: a detailed per-request breakdown and a summary report containing min/avg/max/stdev statistics. Built with multithreading for high-speed checks, this project demonstrates practical Python automation with clean input handling, dynamic concurrency, and exportable performance analytics. Perfect for developers, analysts, bug bounty hunters, or anyone testing the speed of web services.
